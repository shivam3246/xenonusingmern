I have made a car selling website using mern stack.Firstly, I started by creating a backend folder in which I used NodeJS to connect my mongoDB and then I created few endpoints like to createuser and checking the logedin user. Then, after that I cross-verified this by checking it into my MongoDB. Adding more to it I have used mongoose, express-validator and concurrently in my project. Then, I went with my front-end which probably I was not able to complete correctly. I started my front-end with ReactJs and bootstrap but wasn't able to complete it.
